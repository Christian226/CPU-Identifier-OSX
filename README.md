# CPU-Identifier-OSX

## Source code will be available later.

This tiny app can detect the CPU chipset of your iPhone. For iPhone 6s / 6s Plus, it can also detect the manufactory (TSMC or Samsung) of A9 chip.

The compiled (and signed) binary file that I distrubte would upload the chip model, device model and hashed (MD5) SN number to my server (since I don't want to get duplicated records), but it's for statistics only. Therefore, I can't identify you from these information.


## Usage
Plug your iPhone to your Mac, and then open this app.
If it can't detect your device, try to restart the app or replug the cable.

You can detect the CPU manufactory even when the device is not activated.
